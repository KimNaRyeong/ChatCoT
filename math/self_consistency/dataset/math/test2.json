        "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem. If the first die shows a 1, the second die can be anything (6 cases). If the first die shows 2 or 4, the second die is limited to 1, 3, or 5 ($2\\cdot3 = 6$ cases). If the first die shows 3, the second die can be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (4 cases). If the first die shows 5, the second die can be anything but 5 (5 cases). If the first die shows 6, the second die can be only 1 or 5 (2 cases). There are 36 ways to roll two dice, 23 of which are valid, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{36}}$.",

If, however, the first roll is a $3$ or a $4,$ in each case there will be two rolls that satisfy the given condition- $1$ or $5$ and $2$ or $6,$ respectively. This gives us another $4$ successful combinations for a total of $8.$\n\nSince there are $6$ possible outcomes when a die is rolled, there are a total of $6\\cdot6=36$ possible combinations for two rolls, which means our probability is $\\dfrac{8}{36}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}.$\n\nOR\n\nWe can also solve this problem by listing all the ways in which the two rolls have a positive difference of $2:$ $$(6,4), (5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3).$$  So, we have $8$ successful outcomes out of $6\\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities, which produces a probability of $8/36 = 2/9.$",

Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$.
