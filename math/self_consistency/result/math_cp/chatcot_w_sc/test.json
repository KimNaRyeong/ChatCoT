There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).

                "solution": "Every four-digit palindrome is of the form $ABBA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits.  The four-digit number $ABBA$ is divisible by 4 if and only if the two-digit number $BA$ is divisible by 4.  In particular, the digit $A$ must be even.\n\nSince $ABBA$ is a four-digit number, $A$ cannot be 0, so $A$ must be at least 2.  For $A = 2$, so the smallest digit $B$ for which $BA = B2$ is divisible by 4 is 12.  Therefore, the smallest smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4 is $\\boxed{2112}$."

All two-digit palindromes (11, 22,...99) can be factored into 11 and a number between 1 and 9. The only factor that all of them share is $\\boxed{11}$, so that is our answer."

Ignoring the colon, how many different palindromes are possible on a 12-hour digital clock displaying only the hours and minutes? (Notice a zero may not be inserted before a time with a single-digit hour value. Therefore, 01:10 may not be used.)",
                "solution": "First, consider the three-digit palindromes.  There are $9$ choices for the first digit (the hour): $1$, $2$,..., $9$.  There are $6$ choices for the second digit (the tens digit of the minutes): $0$, $1$, ..., $5$.  The last digit (the units digit of the minutes) has to be the same as the first digit.  So there are $9 \\cdot 6 = 54$ three-digit palindromes.\n\nSecond, consider the four-digit palindromes.  The first digit (the tens digit of the hour) must be $1$.  There are $3$ choices for the second digit (the units digit of the hour): $0$, $1$, and $2$.  The third digit must be the same as the second digit, and the fourth digit must be the same as the first digit.  So there are $3$ four-digit palindromes.\n\nIn total, there are $54+3=\\boxed{57}$ different palindromes."

Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit.
